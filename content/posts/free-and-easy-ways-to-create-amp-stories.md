## What are AMP Stories

AMP stories are part of Google's AMP project that enables supported search results  from google to open as quickly as possible. This is due to the strict restrictions to what scripts or style the website can contain as there are particular scripts that AMP pages work with. Next time when you open a google search result and you see the thunderbolt sign on the url bar, you are on an AMP page

AMP stories are AMP pages that are visually rich and are typically displayed as full screen images with text overlayed on it.  These stories work in a way that is similar to the stories found on social networks. The reader can then tap through the slides of the story by tapping on the edges of the screen.
