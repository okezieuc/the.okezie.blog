## What are Olympiads?

Olympiads are contests/examinations targeted toward high school students. Olympiads test student’s knowledge outside the regular school curriculum or rather how they are able to apply basic principles taught in school to solve more advanced problems.

## What subjects are tested in Olympiads?

Olympiad exams are based on different subjects, there are Mathematics Olympiads, Physics Olympiads, Chemistry olympiads, Olympiads in Informatics, biology, etc. There are olympiads for all science subjects. There are also olympiads for other subjects like English, Geography, etc.

## How difficult are Olympiads

Different Olympiad competitions have different levels of difficulties. In a good number of olympiads, you write a level that is based on your current school grade and the higher the level you are participating in, the greater the difficulty.

Let’s take America’s AMC as an example. There are three levels, AMC 8, AMC 10 and AMC 12. The different levels are meant for students who are currently in or in a grade less than 8, 10 and 12 respectively.

In Nigeria, there are two levels of difficulty – junior and senior. The junior level is for students in JSS3(grade 9) and below while the senior level is for SS3(grade 12) and below.

Every subject usually has a prestigious Olympiad which should be the one with the most difficult questions. These contests bring the best students that every nation has to offer to come together and compete. For mathematics it is the[IMO](https://www.imo-official.org/),[IPHO](https://www.ipho-new.org/)for physics, ICHO for chemistry, IBO for biology, IOI for Informatics and the list goes on.

## Can I attend any Olympiad I wish to attend?

Many olympiads are open to anyone to attend as long as you meet the age or class criteria provided. But the most prestigious ones like the IMO and the other ones I listed above don’t permit you to attend directly. You have to be selected by your country through a series of examinations. The number of people that can attend these olympiads from a country ranges from four to six depending on the subject.

## What can I do to perform well in Olympiads?

As I pointed out earlier, olympiads test you beyond what you learn in your typical classes so one of the first steps to perform well in olympiads is to get familiar with the regular school coursework for that subject as this will be the foundation for the rest of your olympiad study

After doing this, you have to research for valuable books for the subject you plan on competing in, and put in a good amount of effort into studying these books. It is very common for students not to read books from cover to cover so if you are not able to do that, don’t feel worried. Just keep reading on. I believe this quote by Tom Hanks has a lot to say so I will just drop it here.

While reading these books, you will also like to take a look at previous questions from the competition. These questions will help to give you a feel of how difficult that particular test will be. These questions are usually available on the website

## Conclusion

Today we have learnt about what olympiads are, the subjects that they are available in some basic things you can do to succeed. I will subsequently be writing about other helpful topics like books that can help you to improve. I will also write about other sources that will be helpful to your Olympiad journey.
