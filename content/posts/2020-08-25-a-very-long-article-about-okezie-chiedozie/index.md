## The Mathematics Part

Let me start off with the thing that most people know me for – Mathematics. Mathematics is a very important part of me, I grew up with mathematics and I haven’t left it alone yet. I participate in Mathematics Olympiads and I have a good number of laurels in Olympiads. I have previously qualified for an IMO, although I did not later attend it.

## Do I do sports?

People who try to discover my life outside mathematics ask me what sport I participate in. I have an answer to that – Table Tennis. I play table tennis when I have the free time. I play with the pen-holder grip, which a lot of people don’t see as normal. There is a long history behind me playing pen-holder. If you ask if I am a master in table tennis, then I will definitely say no. But I will also tell you that not everyone can beat me in table tennis, and I mean it.

## Youtube Things

Aside sports, I like YouTube. If you ask what I watch the most on YouTube, then I won’t say comedy. Who doesn’t watch comedy? Don’t also expect me to say Numberphile. I watch his videos, his videos are great if you will like to know more about Mathematics, but I haven’t watched a lot of his videos. The things I watch on YouTube that I don’t think that everyone else watches are Ted and Ted-ed. Ted is a very nice place to improve yourself and hear about other peoples professional experiences and life experiences. Ted-ed is almost the same but it is more biased towards education and the videos are animations.

## Me and Computers

Another major part of me aside from Mathematics is computers, I also grew up for the most part with computers. I learnt some programming languages from e-books and my good friend Google, and I am using it to solve a lot of my problems. I am also learning some real-life languages, I speak three languages. I love customizing my desktop and giving it my own personal look instead of staying with the natural blue windows desktop. Due to the need for customization, I have also installed (and uninstalled) a lot of operating systems on my laptop, something may be a little dangerous to do. I also like open-source software, which is also a reason why I was trying out other operating systems. Open-source software sometimes is the best, although they are less likely to have a beautiful user interface.

This is an insight into who I am and what I do. I hope that if there isn’t anything else you can learn, you are able to learn that I don’t do only mathematics.
