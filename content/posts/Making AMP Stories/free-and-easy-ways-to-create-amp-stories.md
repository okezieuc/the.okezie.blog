## What are AMP Stories

AMP stories are part of Google's AMP project that enables supported search results  from google to open as quickly as possible. This is due to the strict restrictions to what scripts or style the website can contain as there are particular scripts that AMP pages work with. Next time when you open a google search result and you see the thunderbolt sign on the url bar, you are on an AMP page

AMP stories are AMP pages that are visually rich and are typically displayed as full screen images with text overlayed on it.  These stories work in a way that is similar to the stories found on social networks. The reader can then tap through the slides of the story by tapping on the edges of the screen.

## Two ways of going about creating AMP Stories

There are two paths I suggest you have to choose between while creating your AMP stories.

1. Creating your own templates and writing code for them
2. Using a WYSIWYG editor

If you want to make your own original templates, you can refer to this very helpful article I made to guide you to start making AMP stories.

WYSIWYG is an acronym for What-You-See-is-What-You-Get. If you decide to make your own templates, you will be writing many lines of code but WYSIWYG editors make the process easier by providing you a visual interface to create your stories. When you use these editors, all you have to do is to write text and place images and you will be done.

Today we'll be comparing two AMP story makers that I am very familiar with - Ampstor and MakeStories. On both websites, they make it very clear to the end users that the editor is truly visual and there is zero coding required. The two websites are in beta stage but they work perfectly and there is little to worry about.

## Number of available templates

Having more templates helps make each of your stories have a unique look, it makes every story you make to stand out on it's own and not look like a recycled version of another story. If the stories you are planning to make are about a product, I feel like MakeStories will be a good option for you. If you stories are geared away from a product then Ampstor will be the good choice for you. If we count the number of templates that are available in the two platforms, the number of templates on Ampstor is a lot larger than that of MakeStories.

## Site Responsiveness and ease of use

After using both the editors, I can in terms of performnce and ease of use, MakeStories is a lot better than that of Ampstor. The Ampstor page has very minor lags that you will easily percieve while using it, so you may have to wait for some milliseconds after typing to see what you typed appear. Meanwhile on MakeStories, evrything is fluid, and the site responds to clicks quickly. In MakeStories, you can organize your stories in different folders, so iff you are planning on creating a lot of stories and want your workplace to be organized, the MakeStories has exactly what you need. In Ampstor, you can give tags to stories, and using tags can help you stay organized but folders are a lot easier to work with as we are already used to them.

## Media Availability

Since photos are a huge part of AMP stories, availability of photos on each of these platforms is very important to successful content creation. Both of the websites make use of the Unsplash API to fetch images so finding photos wont be a problem. They also both have import functionality so in case you can't find what you need from the image search on their website, you can upload you own images and use them instead. MakeStories has an edge here as it makes it possible to search for videos and illustrations too so you are not limited to only images.

AMP stories support backgroud music and both websites have the ability to import sounds which is very good, although not too many people add audio to their stories

## SEO Optimization

SEO is a very crucial part of running a website because it is the thing that will get people to come to your site. MakeStories has a better way of allowing you to add SEO metadata to your stories. In the settings of MakeStories, you can set the author name, publisher favicon and add your analytics info there and all that metadata will automatically be added to the stories that you make. On Ampstor, there is no such setting as you have to go individually and add the relevant SEO and analytics data to your website.

## Story Publishing

The most important part of the whole AMP story making stuff is publishing the content you made because then is when the content goes live. On Ampstor, you can export your code to HTML and download, publish to a webflow or upload it to your own servers via FTP or host it with Ampstor on their website.

On MakeStories, you can export the story to a zip file that can then be moved to the servers it will be hosted from, you can also send your stories via FTP to where they will be served from. MakeStories can also host your stories for you if you don't have your won hosting on an onl.st shortlink. There are many more options on MakeStories like widget emped, Wordpress and AWS Publish.

## Final Verdict

MakeStories beats Ampstor in majority of the factors considered most especially site responsiveness and ease of use, which ii consider very important. However Ampstor beats MakeStories on the most important factor to me which is the ammount of templates that are available so I will say that if you plan on creating just one or two stories MakeStories will be perfect for you but if you plan on creating a lot, then you have a big decision before you - to choose a large number of very good themes(Ampstor) or to choose the one that is easier to use but less diverse in templates (MakeStories)

If you feel like you want to have more control over what the pages you make look like, then you can create your own template. I creates a detailed introduction to writeing code for AMP soties
