Six Degrees of separation theory explains how close we are to each other. The phrase “The world is a global village” is now very common as we have a lot more things that connect us today more than a hundred years back. The internet is bringing us closer to each other than ever before and slowly we realize that we are really becoming a global village.

## The Meaning of Six Degrees of Separation

The Six Degrees of separation theory tries to explain how close we are to each other. The theory says that you can create a relationship between any two people by connecting at most six intermediaries. This means that you know someone that knows someone that knows someone that knows someone that knows someone that knows me. And similarly, you also have a chain of relationships to anyone you can think of.

Because of uncontacted tribes, it is easy to reason that the theory is false. Uncontacted tribes are communities that are living with little or no contact with the world outside them. There are some experiments called small-world experiments attempting to back up the theory of the six degrees of separation. Some of these experiments have shown that six is a plausible degree of separation.

## Small World Experiments

One such experiment was conducted by Stanley Milgram. While conducting the experiment, he gave some volunteers a mail to deliver to try to deliver to a target and they were to play by the following rules:

1. If you know the target, you deliver the mail directly to the target.
2. If you don’t know him, you write your name on the mail and send it to someone who you think is closer to the target than you.

Although a lot of messages were not delivered due to people’s unwillingness to forward the messages, the ones that were delivered passed through the hands of five to seven people, showing that there is a high chance of the theory of six degrees of separation may be true.

Another small world experiment was carried out by Microsoft. They considered people to be friends if they had previously exchanged messages on Microsoft Messenger, a social networking app that was retired in 2014.

The results of the experiment suggested that there were around 6.7 degrees of separation between two randomly selected people. They also noticed that there were some people pairs whose degree of separation went as high as 30. This meant that this theory may be true for the most part.

## What next?

LinkedIn is a social network that tries to play on a concept of degrees of separation. It allows users to connect to people who they know. After connecting with such people, they are able to see second-degree connections – which are people that are connected to people you are connected to, you can also see your third-degree connections. The system doesn’t take your connections further than that, which I believe may be because each degree gives you an exponentially higher number of connections.

The six degrees of separation, I believe plays a role in the quick spread of rumors on the internet and also in the spread of infectious diseases. I will discuss this in a later post. You can try the [WikiGame](http://www.thewikigame.com) where you have to find a path between two seemingly random articles by clicking links on the article you are on? If you get stuck or even feel like it is impossible to form a path joining the two articles you are given, then you can use the [Six Degrees of Wikipedia website](https://www.thewikigame.com/) to find possible paths between the two articles. I can assure you that the path will a lot shorter than you expect.
